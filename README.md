# 🛠️ Data Engineer Portfolio

Hi there! I'm Anna — welcome to my growing **Data Engineering Portfolio** 🚀

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects I've completed through various data analytics and engineering courses, as well as personal learning challenges. Each project is designed to strengthen key skills in the modern data stack — from data wrangling and pipeline building to database management and cloud integration.


### 💡 What you’ll find here:

- Projects using Python, pandas, SQL, dbt and Git  
- ETL workflows and data pipeline simulations  
- Practice with cloud tools like AWS and GCP  
- Data modeling and visualization examples  
- Experiments and self-driven exercises for continuous learning  


# [Web Scrapping - Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/AnnaPrus/web_scrapping/tree/main)

- Project Overview: Used Webscraping techniques to extract information from the website "the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world" as per requirement. Used Pandas data frames and dictionaries to transform data as per requirement. Loaded the processed information to CSV files and as Database tables. Queried the database tables using SQLite3 and pandas libraries. Logged the progress of the code properly.

- Technologies Used: Python, Beautiful Soup, Pandas

- Final Outcome: *[the output file with the list of trasformed banks](https://github.com/AnnaPrus/web_scrapping/blob/main/banks_transformed.csv)*
